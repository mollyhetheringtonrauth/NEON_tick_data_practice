DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10093.001

Name: Ticks sampled using drag cloths

Description: Abundance and density of ticks collected by drag and/or flag sampling (by species and/or lifestage)

NEON Science Team Supplier: TOS

Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Sampling protocol. Tick abundance and diversity are sampled at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites using drag or flag sampling techniques. For additional details on protocol, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Sampling. Following collection, samples are sent to a professional taxonomist where ticks are identified to species and lifestage and/or sex. Identified ticks are then processed for pathogen analysis or preserved for final archiving. Products resulting from this sampling and processing include records of when ticks were sampled and the taxonomic and abundance data of ticks captured. For additional details, see protocol [NEON.DOC.014045](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.014045vH): TOS Protocol and Procedure: Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Sampling and science design [NEON.DOC.000911](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.000911vA): TOS Science Design for Vectors and Pathogens.

Latency:
The expected time from data and/or sample collection in the field to data publication is as follows, for each of the data tables (in days) in the downloaded data package. See the Data Product User Guide for more information.

tck_fielddata_pub:  30

Brief Design Description: During the growing season, sampling is conducted every three weeks at sites where ticks have previously been detected and every six weeks elsewhere. Sampling also occurs only if the high temperature on two consecutive days prior to planned sampling exceeds 0Â°C.

Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at NEON terrestrial sites.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON observational systems (OS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:
   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

   SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.

   DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;

   PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog).

   REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.

   HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. 

   VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505. 

   TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year.

   DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table.

   YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file.

   PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below).

   GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ.

Time stamp conventions:
   YYYY: Year
   YY: Year, last two digits only
   MM: Month: 01-12
   DD: Day: 01-31
   T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning
   HH: Hours: 00-23
   mm: Minutes: 00-59
   SS: Seconds: 00-59
   Z: Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time), or UTC

Obfuscation of Personnel Information: At times it is important to know which data were collected by particular observers. In order to protect privacy of NEON technicians while also providing a way to consistently identify different observers, we obfuscate each NEON personnel name by internally linking it to a unique string identifier (e.g., Jane Doe=ByrziN0LguMJHnInl2NM/trZeA5h+c0) and publishing only the identifier.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS
------------------

Queries for this data product will return data from tck_fielddata and tckTaxonomy subset to data collected during the date range specified. The protocol dictates that each of 6 plotIDs per site is sampled during each eventID (six expected record per eventID). An record from tck_fielddata may have zero or more related records in tck_taxonomy, depending on whether ticks were present in the sample. Duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry abberations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
